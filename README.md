## *symbolic music analysis and composition library in Python*

**Sebastian** is a symbolic music analysis and composition library written in
Python.

I partly think of it as being a "Mathematica for music". By symbolic, I mean
that it is focused more on the sorts of abstractions made by music notation
and theories of harmony and counterpoint than lower level numerical
operations that one might use in, say, music synthesis.

I hope it to be very practical as an analysis tool for existing compositions
(especially from the common practice period) and also a tool for
computer-assisted composition. It will also be a bit of a test bed for ideas
I've had for a while around applying linguistics and abstract algebra to
music.

I spoke about Sebastian at PyCon 2013 and my slides are available at:

A video of the talk should be available shortly.
